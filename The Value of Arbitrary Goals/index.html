   The Value of Arbitrary Goals
  </h1>
  <p>
   I believe there is extraordinary value to be had in picking arbitrary goals.
  </p>
  <p>
   Through some pop-culture osmosis I absorbed some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">absurdist</a> philosophy like <a href="https://dhspriory.org/kenny/PhilTexts/Camus/Myth%20of%20Sisyphus-.pdf">Camus</a> which basically states “There is no meaning to life, and to look for a logical meaning from outside of the universe is fruitless.”
  </p>
  <p>
   I also really value <a href="/Self%20Improvement">Self Improvement</a> which by the logic of absurdism itself is <em>absurd</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
   I picked up a lot from <a href="https://beaumiles.com">Beau Miles</a> and his use of goals as ways to tell stories and to discover himself
  </p>
  <p>
   In the face of absurdism, we are allowed to pick arbitrary goals and treat them as valuable as any other.
  </p>
  <p>
   Picking goals “arbitrarily” is nearly impossible as we are the result of our past selves navigating a past environment, and so is any such “choice.” And if one does attempt to (via quantum-based-randomness  or other non-deterministic process) choose a truly arbitrary goal I would argue the meta-goal of picking and achieving a truly random goal is itself not truly arbitrary.
