 <h1>
  Just Quit
 </h1>
 <hr>
 Whatever it is that you're holding onto, just quit.
 <hr>
 If "Tomorrow" is the day you'll quit, That's actually okay, you'll quit tomorrow.
<br>But today, you'll get a head start on tomorrow:
	you'll just stop for today, but tomorrow is the day you <i> quit</i>. 

Use the headstart, you'll already have an extra day when you quit tomorrow.

 <small>*I think I stopped drinking 1-2months before this, but didn't record an exact date. So this is a conservative estimate</small>
<br>
  <small>*Without watching youtube algorithmically, if I search for guitar tutorials, or for music, I can still use the website, without it leading me to problematic behaviour, this is just how I've found is healthy engagement for me.</small>
